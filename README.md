# Alex's Portfolio

## Welcome!

Hi! Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm Alex Zheng, an undergraduate student studying Economics with a passion for finance and data science. Here you can find information about my recent science projects.


## [Project 1: WorldQuant University Applied Data Science Lab](https://www.kaggle.com/work/collections/14331416)
- Analysed 6582 Buenos Aires properties, determining price factors. Developed predictive model using linear regression, with robust data pipeline handling missing values, categorical features, and overfitting. Techniques included loading CSV files, cleaning data, and creating visualizations like Mapbox scatter plots and heatmaps.
- Built Autoregression Models to predict PM2.5 levels in Kenya from a MongoDB database and improved model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
- Built Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Model using SQL database to predict earthquake damage to buildings in Nepal.
- Built ensemble models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Trees with imbalanced data (JSON) using resampling and evaluated classification models using precision and recall
- Applied concepts of unsupervised learning via building a k-means model; Conducted feature selection for clustering based on variance; Reduced high-dimensional data using principal component analysis (PCA); Designed, built and deployed a Dash web application.
- Implemented a three-tiered interactive web application, including building a choropleth map displaying the global distribution of ADSL students, creating a custom Python class for ETL processes, and conducting and analysing an experiment using a Chi-Square test.
- Forecasted asset volatility in India using GARCH time series modelling and developing a custom API for predictions
