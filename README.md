## Welcome!

Hi, Welcome to my portfolio site! I'm Alex Zheng, an undergraduate student studying Economics with a passion for finance and data science. Here you can find information about my data science projects.

## [Project 1: Hong Kong Housing Price Data Science Project](https://github.com/alexzheng123/Hong-Kong-Housing-Price)
- Scraped housing information from Centaline Property Agency.
- Cleaned and processed the data, including geocoding addresses.
- Conducted various visualizations and analyses to understand the housing market in Hong Kong.
- Investigated the influence of location and house size on property prices.
- Key insights:
  - Location has a more significant impact on house prices than size.
  - Detailed visualizations of housing data on an interactive map.
  - Statistical analysis revealing correlations between price and area.
